                <p>Love is a temporary madness,  it 

          erupts like volcanoes and then 

          subsides.</p> 
          <p>And when it subsides you 

          have to make a decision. You have to 

          work out whether your roots have so 

          entwined together that it is 

          inconceivable that you should ever 

          part.</p> 
          <p>Because this is what love is. 

          Love is not breathlessness, it is not 

          excitement, it is not the promulgation 

          of promises of eternal passion. That 

          is just being in love, which any fool 

          can do.</p>

          <p>Love itself is what is left over 

          when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a 

          fortunate accident.</p>

          <p>Those that truly 

          love have roots that grow towards 

          each other underground, and, when 

          all the pretty blossoms have fallen 

          from their branches, they find that 

          they are one tree and not two.
